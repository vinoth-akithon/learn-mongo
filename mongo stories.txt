It is working on the concept of Collections and Documents.
collections --> Tables in RDMS.
Documents --> rows in RDMS.
Datas are stored as key,value pairs.
Developed by 10gen company.
MongoDb collections do not enforce schemas, the documents are collections of key-value pairs with dynamic schemas.
It is Document Oriented Storage.datas are stored in the form of JSON.
_id --> 12 byte hexadecimal id(It is unique for every documents).
    1. first 4 - current timestamp.
    2. next 3 - machine id.
    3. next 2 - MongoDb server process id.
    4. final 3 - simple incremental value.
We can provide _id while inserting doc otherwise mongodb generate by its own.
